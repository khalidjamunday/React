# Notes
1. useState() hook:-
    rp-3 counter.jsx m hai 
    
2. 1. using children content as prop
   2. pass function as prop
   rp-4 app.jsx button.jsx card.jsx 

3. StateLifting
   rp-5 refer notes and app.jsx card.jsx

4. Conditional Rendering-> cond. ke basis pe kuch render krna  
to do : can later create out setLogged in 
-->(In React, component names should always start with an uppercase letter, otherwise, React treats them as regular HTML tags rather than components.)

5. Event handling -> which was kinda tedious task js here simple (event.target tells kis el. pe event trigger hua h)
   rp-7 ek do line in notes app.jsx
   IMPORTANT -> immediate invokation (preffered fucntion refrence), event.stopPropogation, e.prevent.default
   Can see last part of video babbar showed react documentation
